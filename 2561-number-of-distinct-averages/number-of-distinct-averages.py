# Time Complexity Analysis
# Sorting (O(n log n))
# Two-Pointer Iteration (O(n))
# Adding to Set (O(1) per operation, total O(n))
# Final time complexity: O(n log n) + O(n) = O(n log n).

# Space Complexity Analysis
# Set stores at most n/2 unique values (O(n)), but since we donâ€™t use extra data structures beyond a few variables, it's O(n) in the worst case.
# However, if we consider only extra space apart from input, it's O(1).
# Final space complexity: O(n) worst case, but O(1) auxiliary space.
